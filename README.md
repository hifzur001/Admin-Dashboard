# Admin-Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard project is a web-based application designed to allow system administrators to monitor and manage various aspects of the system. The dashboard includes features such as a login page, a navigation menu, data tables, charts, and graphs. One of the features of the dashboard is a section that displays the users who are currently online using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To achieve this, the dashboard uses AJAX to send requests to the server at regular intervals to retrieve a list of online users. The server sends a response with the list of online users in JSON format, which the client-side application then uses to update the UI.

The online users are displayed in cards that show their profile picture, name, and status. The cards are designed using HTML and CSS to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, allowing administrators to quickly see who is online. Each card also includes a button that allows the administrator to perform certain actions on the user, such as sending a message or initiating a video call.

After logging in, the administrator has access to all the features of the dashboard. They can monitor various aspects of the system, including user activity, system performance, and resource utilization. They can also perform various actions, such as adding or removing users, modifying system settings, and generating reports.

Overall, the Admin Dashboard project is an essential tool for system administrators who need to monitor and manage various aspects of a system. The "who is online" feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is just one of many features that make the dashboard an indispensable tool for system administrators.
